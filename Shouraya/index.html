        Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a
        22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end,
        each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at
        the wicket with the bat (and running between the
        wickets), while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the
        field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss
        each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and
        dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either
        catching the ball after it is hit by the bat and before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball
        before a batter can cross the crease in front of the
        wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated
        by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match
        referee in international matches.</p>
    <p style="font-size:25px"> Forms of cricket range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a single innings of 20
        overs, to Test matches played over five days.
        Traditionally cricketers play
        in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit,
        some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused
        by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam
        enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string. </p>
